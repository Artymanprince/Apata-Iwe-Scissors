    <h4>
        Hello friend.
    </h4>
    <p>
        You may be wondering, "what is this about". <br/> As you should. <br/> This is about a game I wrote basically, I named it <b>"Apata, Iwe, Scissors"</b>, which is Yoruba for <i>"Rock, Paper, Scissors"</i> like i emphasized in my git r340M3 "I spent nearly 4 days thinking about how to write the functions and their logic", with a back and forth edit coupled with hundreds of google search to understand certain concepts. <br/> I would have used a new concept I understood along the way though, IIFE I see it fit to include it when I add buttons I will. <br/> Until then, let it remain at IIFE and if only. :) . <br/> 
        Well, I wrote the final code today, <b>Janauary 23rd, 2022</b> at exactly <b> 1.41 a.m</b>. <br/> To play, use only console and run the function <b>game()</b>. <br/> Yea, cheers.
